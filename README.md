## Optimizations
I feel the UI class of the code base can be refactored further if I had more time (I rushed the ending). After completion i noticed aspects of my UI class code that should be in my Project or Tasks Class. It was also my first time working with date objects and also date-fns, the due Date on the "Today" and "This week" filters could be made consitent and not display different formats. 

## Lessons Learned:

This is was a good way for me to learn about and practice OOP. I could have done a lot better in seperation of concerns of each class object, but also with the implementation of abstraction and encapsulation in this project shows I did learn somethings.
